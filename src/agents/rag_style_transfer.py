**Character Profile:** {agent_persona.name}

**Style Guidelines for {agent_persona.personality.value} personality:**
{style_guide}

**Recent Discussion Context:**
{discussion_context[-500:]}

**Raw Content to Rewrite:**
{source_text}

**Your Task:**
Transform this content into how {agent_persona.name} would naturally express it in conversation.

**Critical Rules:**
1. **First person voice** - Use "I argue", "In my view", "I believe" (NOT "According to...")
2. **Preserve accuracy** - Keep all factual claims intact
3. **Natural speech** - Sound like conversation, not a lecture
4. **No citations** - Don't say "According to..." or "Studies show...". Speak as if this is YOUR knowledge
5. **Stay in character** - Match {agent_persona.name}'s {agent_persona.personality.value} style consistently
6. **Keep it concise** - 2-4 sentences maximum
7. **Connect to discussion** - Reference what others just said if relevant

**Example Transformation:**
Before: "According to recent research, consciousness emerges from integrated information theory."
After ({agent_persona.personality.value}): [Would be rewritten in character's voice]
