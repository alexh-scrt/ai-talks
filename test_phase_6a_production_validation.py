**Alice:** We should suspend judgment until more evidence arrives.

Consequence Test: This is a very long paragraph that restates the prior argument and adds unnecessary prose. It goes on and on with redundant information about suspending action until we have more certainty about the philosophical implications. The discussion needs to consider multiple perspectives and various philosophical traditions that have grappled with these questions throughout history.

**Bob:** I agree with that approach completely.

**Charlie:** But sometimes we must act despite uncertainty and ambiguity.

Consequence Test: Another verbose block here that talks about commitment and choice under ambiguity, referencing Pascal's wager and other cases where agents choose under unclear conditions. This connects to pragmatic decision-making when certainty is impossible and we must proceed with action even when metaphysical doubt persists about the ultimate nature of reality.

**David:** That makes sense in many practical situations.

**Simone:** We should suspend judgment until more evidence arrives.

Consequence Test: This uncertainty about consciousness raises fundamental questions about the nature of mind and its relationship to matter. If we suspend judgment on consciousness until we have complete neurological understanding, we might wait indefinitely, as the hard problem of consciousness may be inherently resistant to empirical resolution.

**Aristotle:** Sometimes we must act despite uncertainty.

**Descartes:** I will proceed with methodical doubt but practical maxims.

Consequence Test: The tension between action and uncertainty reveals a deeper philosophical problem. If doubt doesn't suspend action, we see examples like Pascal's wager where agents still choose under ambiguity, making commitments that transcend purely empirical justification.

**Hypatia:** Mathematical reasoning provides a framework.
